        <td>Lionel Andrés "Leo" Messi[note 1] (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] ⓘ; born 24 June 1987) is
          an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Major League Soccer club
          Inter Miami and the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi
          has won a record eight Ballon d'Or awards, a record six European Golden Shoes, and was named the world's best
          player for a record eight times by FIFA.[note 2] Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire
          professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles,
          seven Copa del Rey titles, and the UEFA Champions League four times.[note 3] With his country, he won the 2021
          Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the
          records for most goals in La Liga (474), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League
          (eight), and most assists in La Liga (192) and the Copa América (17). He also has the most international goals
          by a South American male (106). Messi has scored over 800 senior career goals for club and country, and has
          the most goals by a player for a single club (672).Messi relocated to Spain from Argentina aged 13 to join
          Barcelona, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an
          integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he
          helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon
          d'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the
          first player to win the award four times. During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records
          for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The
          following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived
          career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in
          La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in
          2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. Out of
          contract, he signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two seasons at the club and
          winning Ligue 1 twice. Messi joined American club Inter Miami in July 2023, winning the Leagues Cup in August
          of that year.</td>
